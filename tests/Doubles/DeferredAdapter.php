/**
 * A `react/filesystem` adapter that does the work but finishes only when the
 * test says so.
 *
 * `ext-uv` and `ext-eio` are not installed on a plain Windows host — and are
 * not installable in CI on a whim — so without this the asynchronous path
 * would never be executed by the suite, and every ordering bug in it would
 * wait for production to be found. (One already did: the write queue held the
 * promise returned by `then()`, which a synchronous backend resolves *during*
 * registration, so the queue never cleared.)
 *
 * Writes land on the real filesystem, so assertions about the file itself
 * still work; what is deferred is when the promise resolves.
