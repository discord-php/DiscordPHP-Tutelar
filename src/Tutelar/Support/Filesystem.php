/**
 * Every disk access the bridge makes while the event loop is running, in one
 * place, behind promises.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A blocking `file_put_contents()` stops the loop: for as long as it runs, no
 * Discord heartbeat is sent, no Telegram update is read, nothing is relayed.
 * Small as those pauses are here, they are real — this bot's own saves measure
 * around 2-4 ms on a Windows host — and they are exactly the kind of thing
 * that gets worse on the machine you did not test on.
 *
 * So writes go through [react/filesystem](https://github.com/reactphp/filesystem),
 * which performs them off the loop when a native async backend is available.
 *
 * ## What actually happens on each platform
 *
 * `react/filesystem` picks a backend at runtime, and this matters more than it
 * looks:
 *
 *  - **ext-eio** (POSIX only) — genuinely asynchronous.
 *  - **ext-uv** (POSIX *and* Windows; `php_uv.dll` is published on PECL) —
 *    genuinely asynchronous, provided the process is running ReactPHP's
 *    `ExtUvLoop`, which it does automatically when the extension is loaded.
 *  - **neither** — `react/filesystem` falls back to an adapter that calls
 *    `file_get_contents()` and `file_put_contents()` and wraps the result in
 *    an already-resolved promise. It has the asynchronous *shape* and none of
 *    the asynchronous behaviour.
 *
 * That last case is the common one on Windows, so this class does not pretend
 * otherwise. When no async backend is present it does the write itself,
 * blocking — and since it is going to block anyway, it blocks *properly*:
 * `fflush()` and `fsync()`, so a machine that loses power cannot leave a
 * zero-length file where the configuration was. `putContents()` cannot express
 * that, and trading durability for a promise that resolves just as late would
 * be a bad deal.
 *
 * {@see adapter()} reports which of the three is in use, and the bot says so
 * at startup, so nobody has to guess whether they are getting real async I/O.
 *
 * ## What is not routed through here
 *
 * `rename()`, `mkdir()` and `is_file()` are metadata operations measured in
 * microseconds, and `react/filesystem` offers no asynchronous equivalent of
 * the first two at all. They stay as direct calls, deliberately.
 *
 * @since 2.4.0
